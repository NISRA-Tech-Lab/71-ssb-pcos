This section includes a static map and an interactive map. If you create a map in another package and import as an image, ensure it meets accessibility requirements for an infographic.

### Static Map (h3)

This section includes a map generated in R. General principles to consider are:

- ensure contrast between text labels and background colour is at least 4.5:1
- ensure contrast between adjacent colours is at least 3:1, if they don't use borders that do
- verify using online tools like [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- ensure colour is not the only way of conveying meaning
- use clear and descriptive labels

Here the data labels are displayed on the map, alt text is included and the shapefile has been simplified to reduce the file size.

We have used 3 colours. More than 3 colours increases the difficulty of creating sufficient contrast.

Ensure the data underlying the maps is accessible to users who cannot perceive images. In this case, the data is in a table in a previous section. You could also make it available as a download.

Include descriptive text before or after the map.

### Interactive Map (h3)

This section shows the same map produced as an interactive plot.
The figures are displayed on the map, council names show on hover and the council name and figures display on click.
The shapefile has been simplified to reduce file size and not slow page load speed.

Ensure the data underlying the maps is accessible to users who cannot perceive images. In this case, the data is in a table in a previous section. You could also make it available as a download.

The default rendering tabs through the LGDs but the focus area is not visible for keyboard users. This is an accessibility fail. Additional code has been added to remove the map from the tab order and to add alt text to the LGDs for screen reader users. See sections of code in the final code chunk (download buttons) which creates alt text and in the script section at the very end of the code to create an array of alt texts for the map and remove tabs from the LGDs.  

Include descriptive text before or after the map.
