# RAP Skeleton v1.1.0

## :newspaper: Aim
The aim of the RAP Skeleton is to bring together the things Tech Lab has learned through its Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) projects into a reusable template. This will allow us to get started on projects more quickly and reuse (or make reusable) code developed for customers.

## :raising_hand: Audience
Initially Tech Lab itself expects to be the primary customer but we hope experienced R users who have already published reports using R/RMarkdown can make use of it too. Unfortunately we can only guarantee support for customers as defined in our project scopes.

## :thumbsup: What the RAP Skeleton is 

:white_check_mark: A template to help Tech Lab with future RAP projects  
:white_check_mark: A foundation for users to independently start building their RAP  
:white_check_mark: A template for 'light touch' RAP customers to start their project with  
:white_check_mark: A place for users to reference one way of doing things  
:white_check_mark: A product that will change over time  

## :thumbsdown: What the RAP Skeleton is not 

:x: Fully documented  
:x: A complete reference for good practice R / accessibility / programming / project management etc.  
:x: The only way to produce a RAP / HTML / spreadsheets etc.

## :question: What's new

- Configuration now found in `code/config.R`  
- Data processing now found in `code/data_prep.R`  
- Spreadsheet now found in `code/excel_tables.R`  
- Function to create and embed Excel/CSV per chart/table (see `code/functions/make_tables.R`)  
- Departmental colours/logos baked in  
- Project structure changes (dedicated folders for code, data, outputs)  
- Various additions to `code/functions/` folder (for reference and untested outside of the projects they were made for)  
- Pre-release warning coded (see `prerelease` option in Rmd YAML)  
- Notification for mobile users that some charts may not be optimised for mobile viewing

## :bell: Getting started

### renv

#### What is renv?

Renv is a tool that supports reproducibility in R projects. See [their website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for more details. 

#### Why are we moving to renv?

Renv supports the reproducibility of projects both over time (so a project from 2 years ago is more likely to work because you can get the exact packages it was built with) and between users (if you have code problem and your colleague doesn't, you can usually rule out package version differences as the cause). It also helped us solve problems with repository issues that were presenting randomly within and between users.

#### Is renv perfect?

No. renv introduces issues itself, but we feel these are more manageable and easier to pinpoint than alternatives. The main issue we have found is when a package updates and a user is forced to build an older version from source - with `sf`/`terra` in particular this requires updates to Rtools (a program installed alongside R to help building packages). Newer versions of Rtools seem to work with newer packages, but break building very old versions of packages. We're still exploring this area.

#### renv setup

- Download/clone this project and open the project (`rap-skeleton.Rproj`) 
- To install and configure renv for this project, run `source("renv/activate.R")`  
- Disable the MRAN repository using `options(renv.config.mran.enabled = FALSE)` (it won't return any results if it works)
- Tell renv to download and install the packages this projects needs with `renv::restore()` and then press 'y' to accept

#### renv setup summary

- Open project 
- `source("renv/activate.R")` 
- `options(renv.config.mran.enabled = FALSE)` 
- `renv::restore()` and press 'y' to accept

#### renv troubleshooting

`terra` `sf` `-lblosc` `-lkea` `-lsz1` related
rspatial packages might give errors while building from source. Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) and find out the latest version[^1] of the troublesome package. Tell renv to use that version using `renvv::record()`. For example, if the latest version of sf is `1.0-12` you would run `renv::record("sf@1.0-12")` and then run `renv::restore()` 
</details>

`mran` `aws` related
e.g. `failed to retrieve 'https://rstudio-buildtools.s3.amazonaws.com/renv/mran/packages.rds' [error code 22]`, re-run `options(renv.config.mran.enabled = FALSE)` (sometimes it re-enables itself) 

`curl` errors / IT security team contact</summary>
When running renv, IT may contact you regarding `curl` being run on your machine. Reference i305810 is related.

[^1]: If a package has been updated recently, CRAN might not be serving the binary - drop the release version down 1 notch until you can get renv to give a binary of that package. For example, on 19/03/2023, `sf` was updated to `1.0-12`. The renv.lock file asks for 1.0-10 but it is only available from source. `1.0-12` is the latest version, but the `r-release` (i.e. the current stable version of R (4.2 at the moment)) binary is listed as `1.0-.11`. Therefore, we need to ask renv for that version with `renv::record("sf@1.0-11")`. CRAN might start serving `1.0-12` as the `r-release` binary in the future.

### Setting up a new repo with the rap-skeleton

#### Get the skeleton
- Download the latest release as a ZIP file from the [latest releases page](https://github.com/NISRA-Tech-Lab/rap-skeleton/releases)
- Extract the contents and rename the folder to something appropriate e.g. from `rap-skeleton-1.0.0` to `01-doj-newpublication`
- Rename the .Rproj file to something appropriate e.g. `01-doj-newpublication.Rproj`
- Open the Rproject file

#### Create your repo on Github and link your project to it
- In Github.com, create a new repository
  - `Repository name` should be the same as the folder you created e.g. `01-doj-newpublication`
  - Make it Private
- Copy the code under `…or create a new repository on the command line`
  ```
  echo "# 01-doj-newpublication" >> README.md   # Creates a README file for you
  git init                                      # Initialises this folder (e.g. 01-doj-newpublication) as a Git folder
  git add README.md                             # Adds README as a file you will commit
  git commit -m "first commit"                  # Adds a commit message
  git branch -M main # Creates                  # Renames the current branch to main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/ddntl/01-doj-newpublication.git # Links your folder to your Github.com repo
  git push -u origin main                       # Pushes your file to the main branch
  ```
- Paste the code into the `Terminal` tab in Rstudio
- A popup will appear. Click `Sign in with your browser`. A tab will open in your browser and authenticate you. **If you get an error here, try running `git push -u origin main` again**
- If you refresh your repo on Github.com, you should now see the README file

#### Upload the project to Github
- In Rstudio's `Terminal`, run 
  - `git add .` to stage all the files. **Ignore the warnings about LF and CRLF.**
  - `git commit -m "initial upload"` to add a commit message
  - `git push` to push them up to the remote repository
- Your files are now on the github repo and you can now begin development
- It is recommended that you modify the README to include project specific information. You could change the README to something like:
```
# My New Project Title

Please refer [the main rap-skeleton README](https://github.com/NISRA-Tech-Lab/rap-skeleton#bell-getting-started) for the most up to date information on using RAP code.
```
- **You need to close down Rstudio and re-open the Rproj file once it is set up to get Rstudio to show the `Git` tab**
